# AngularJS Jumpstart

AngularJS Jumpstart is a sample repository for a workshop to help understand the basics of AngularJS.

The application demo is based off tweets from [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates)

## Getting Started

  - Copy the starter files into a folder on your machine, or clone the repository and work out of the starter folder
  - You will need to run a localhost environment for the last part of the demo to make the AJAX calls function properly. If you don't know how to do this, follow the guides below

## Local Set Up
Two of the easiest ways to set up a localhost server environment are via Node.js or Python.
1. Node.js
    - Install Node.js
    - Install http-server via npm
        ```sh
        $ npm install http-server -g
        ```
    - From the directory with your starter files, run the following:
         ```sh
        $ http-server
        ```
    - Visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser
2. Python
    - Install Python
    - From the directory with your starter files, run the following:
         ```sh
        $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
        ```
    - Visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser

## Add More Features after the Demo
Here are some additional features you could add to the application:
- Add a user rating item to the Details tab that displays the average user submitted rating.
- Build a sorting mechanism that would allow a user to sort the dogs by different criterias.
- What would happen if there were no user reviews for a dog? Add an empty state when no reviews have been submitted.
- Build a form to let people submit their own dogs for review.

## Additional Resources
There are a lot of resources out there to help you learn more about AngularJS as well as HTML/CSS/JS. Some are free and some are not (and some have free trials!), but I encourage you to work through multiple courses on different sites to see what suits you best when learning to code.

Here are a couple of my favorites:

  - [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/)
  - [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/)
